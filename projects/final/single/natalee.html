        <h3>NO ONE EVER DEADNAMES A BUTTERFLY</h3>
        <h4>by Natalee Decker and Emma James
        </h4>

            <div class="vidInfo">
                In her poem and sound design, <i>No One Ever Deadnames a Butterfly</i>, Emma James explores post operative experiences with Facial Feminization Surgery. The work draws on images of her environment, body and emotional landscape, during the two week period of quarantine, directly after being released from the hospital. Throughout the poem, she utilizes the transgender allegory of a butterfly in chrysalis to evoke a sense of delirium, claustrophobia, catharsis and physical transformation. In Natalee Decker’s animated visual accompaniment, she responds to the poem’s metaphors collaging abstract insect swarms, wormy cocoons, glowing roses, mesh faces, dizzy spins around a glass butterfly and colors like dripping candle wax through hazy neon light. Their collaboration is grounded in love, care and the dynamic intersections of disabled, trans and queer experience.
