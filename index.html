                    <h3>Description</h3>

                    <p>This course is an introduction and integration of traditional design tools, camera, and digital
                        technologies for application to multidisciplinary visual thinking, design, communication, and
                        art.
                        Throughout the quarter we will examine the language and histories of moving images and how
                        artists have
                        contributed to and utilized them in their work. We will explore, compare, and contrast
                        industry-standard/normative approaches with radical/experimental takes of these various media.
                        Our aim is to
                        establish a rich understanding of the complex and evolving environment in which artists and
                        designers have
                        been creating moving image art. Students will explore technical, critical, and creative tools to
                        realize
                        moving-image projects and to gain a deeper understanding of moving images as a medium of
                        expression and
                        communication. In a series of mini-assignments and group projects students will explore and
                        study the
                        following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Principles of moving images: timing, perspective, change, and aesthetics.</li>
                        <li>Fundamentals of motion and animation: attributes, keyframes, interpolation, and blending.
                        </li>
                        <li>The basics of digital moving images: codecs, resolution, raster/vector, and conversion.</li>
                        <li>Means of exhibition and presentation: screening, immersive environment, web-based, and
                            projection
                            mapping</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We will explore the field through lectures, readings, screenings, discussions and student
                        presentations. By
                        the end of the quarter, students should have gained basic production and postproduction skills
                        as well as a
                        good understanding of the key concepts relevant to contemporary film, video, new media,
                        installation and
                        animation.<br><br>

                            Note: This syllabus was designed for in-person and on-campus teaching. As COVID-19 has
                            changed the
                            dynamics of our learning experience, this syllabus will be modified and adjusted to conform
                            and address
                            the needs of the class as we progress throughout the quarter.
                        </i></p>

                    <h3>Supplementary Material</h3>
                    <p>All supplementary materials will be provided through a dedicated Google Drive folder. This will
                        be shared
                        with everyone and includes our readings, video tutorials, guides, software, cheatsheets, and
                        most
                        importantly
                        the required assets needed for class projects.</p>

                    <h3>Expectations</h3>
                    <h4>Grading</h4>
                    Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a onclick="openSection('#projects', 'p1')">Midterm project</a> 25%</li>
                        <li><a onclick="openSection('#projects', 'p2')">Final project</a> 25%</li>
                        <li><a onclick="openSection('#projects', 'p3')">Final project documentation</a> 10%</li>
                        <li>Participation 20%</li>
                        <li>Minitasks 20%</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Project grades take into account conceptual, technical, and visual development as well as rigor
                        and
                        creativity. Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs,
                        sufficient work that
                        does nothing more than meeting the requirements will receive Cs.</p>

                    <h4><a onclick='openSection("#projects")'>Projects</a></h4>
                    Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned. Projects may be turned in up to one
                    week late for
                    a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one week late will not be
                    accepted.
                    If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in projects online by the deadline. Extra time
                    will not be
                    given for work lost due to save issues, software errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly
                    backup your
                    files on your desktop, online, and/or on an external harddrive or USB stick in case your computer is
                    lost.</p>

                    <h4>Readings & Discussions</h4>
                    During the quarter, we will have five discussions on a variety of topics. With the exception of the
                    first
                    week, the readings for every week are divided into two topics (signified below with A and B). Each
                    week you
                    are required to read at least one article from each topic. The readings are intended to familiarize
                    you with
                    some of the relevant discussions that relate to moving images. You are not required to write a
                    written
                    response. However every week we will discuss the readings with your peers. Your participation in
                    these
                    discussions will count towards your grade. It is highly recommended to take notes from the readings
                    so that
                    you can easily engage with the topic and the discussion. Since every student is only required to
                    read one
                    article (per topic), the discussions serve as a dialectical engagement to learn from one another and
                    explore
                    the readings in conversation. Moreover, the readings serve as a foundation for discussing the
                    screenings,
                    which are purposefully picked to convey some of the ideas from the readings in practice.</p>

                    <h4>Participation</h4>
                    <p>Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share your thoughts,
                        ask
                        questions, prepare for meetings, offer feedback during critiques. This class is meant to be a
                        safe space in
                        which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being
                        aware and
                        considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this
                        space we are
                        building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility, apologize,
                        and learn.
                        Help each other in this. If you have concerns, please let us know.</p>

                    <h4>Attendance</h4>
                    <p>You get one unexcused absence, no questions asked. Each unexcused absence after that will result
                        in one
                        full letter grade deduction. Three unexcused absences will result in a failed grade in the
                        class. If there
                        is an emergency and you must miss class, email us before class. Absences will not be excused
                        after the fact
                        except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctor’s note. If you are more than 10
                        minutes late, you
                        will be marked tardy. Three tardies result in one unexcused absence. Any disputes should be
                        discussed with
                        the us
                        within two weeks.</p>

                    <h3>Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces</h3>
                    <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic,
                        social, and
                        cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and
                        embrace the
                        different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns,
                        respect
                        self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported,
                        however our
                        differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely
                        important to
                        remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others
                        are
                        undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or
                        vulnerable during
                        debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and instructors is needed
                        to create a
                        supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and
                        conceptually,
                        if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive,
                        avoid being
                        defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn
                        from one
                        another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of
                        work is
                        harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructors. (<a

                    <h3>Disability Services</h3>
                    <p>UCLA strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or
                        experience
                        academic barriers based on a disability, please let me know as soon as possible. It is necessary
                        for you to
                        register with the <a href='http://www.cae.ucla.edu/'>UCLA Center for Accessible Education</a> so
                        that we can
                        establish reasonable accommodations. After registration, make arrangements with me to discuss
                        how to
                        implement these accommodations.</p>

                    <h3>Land Acknowledgement</h3>
                    <p>The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary
                        Lands of
                        the Tongva and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of coercion,
                        dispossession, and colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people that have
                        stewarded it
                        through generations. While a land acknowledgement is not enough, it is the first step in the
                        work toward
                        supporting decolonial and indigenous movements for sovereignty and self-determination. <a

                            Create a 20 seconds video using Blender. Your task is to animate the location, rotation,
                            or
                            scale
                            of a
                            primitive object or an imported object. Using your video editing software of choice, add
                            sound
                            to
                            this
                            video. Upload your video to the DMA Cloud.

                            This week we will explore the basics of navigation in Blender and Davinci Resolve. We
                            will
                            become
                            familiar
                            with the UI and the functionalities provided by these software. Furthermore we will
                            explore
                            the
                            basics of
                            animation, keyframing, rendering, and manipulating 3D and 2D images.

                            Create a 20 seconds video using Blender and found content. For this minitask you must
                            combine
                            both
                            2D and
                            3D elements and synchronize the animation with sound. 2D elements must have animated
                            shapes,
                            while
                            3D
                            elements can be animated as you wish (geometry, material, etc.). Using Davinci Resolve
                            you
                            must
                            composite

                                We will dive deeper into animation, motion and change. We will explore the idea of
                                attributes
                                and
                                properties, and what it means to animate them. We will also have an in-depth look at
                                advanced
                                techniques

                            the
                            prominent
                            ones came to be. We will also explore the composting options in Blender and Davinci
                            Resolve
                            and touch on
                            some of the basic techniques used in compositing. On Wednesday, we are going to have a
                            look
                            at
                            the

                        <p>
                            Choose a short footage of your own or a readily available one. We will be using this for
                            a
                            quick motion
                            tracking experiment. The length of the footage should not exceed 30 seconds. Augment
                            this
                            footage using
                            the motion tracking techniques that we’ve learned in Blender. Apply post processing and
                            composite in
                            Davinci Resolve to seamlessly blend the added elements and the original footage.</p>
                        <h4>Workshops</h4>
                        <p>
                            Much like the previous week, this week is dedicated to compositing and post processing.
                            We
                            will explore
                            these ideas in much more depth. We will have our first look at Davinci Resolve’s Fusion
                            panel
                            and learn
                            about advanced file formats like OpenEXR.

                            This week’s workshops are aimed at executing a project from start to finish. We will
                            begin
                            by
                            collecting
                            content, and creating our assets. Then we will construct a scene in Blender using the
                            animation
                            technique that we’ve learned so far. We will also use some of our skills in motion
                            tracking.
                            The final
                            scene will be rendered, converted, and projection mapped in class. <b>Subject to change

                    <p>Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned Projects may be turned in up to one
                        week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one
                        week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in projects
                        online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save issues, software
                        errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly backup your files on your desktop, online,
                        and/or on an external harddrive or USB stick in case your computer is lost.</p>

                        <p>Your final project is an open investigation of your interests and the techniques learned
                            throughout the course. As usual, it must be paired with audio and sound, which can be
                            musical, ambient, environmental, or experimental. The required length of the project is 3 to
                            5 minutes. You are free to explore any topic that interests you. These can range from
                            exploration of advanced and experimental techniques,
                            software and frameworks that were not touched on in the class, social and political issues,
                            personal and
                            interpersonal investigations, investigations of aesthetics, etc. Collaboration, invention,
                            and exploration are
