                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>This course is an introduction and integration of traditional design tools, camera, and digital
                        technologies for application to multidisciplinary visual thinking, design, communication, and
                        art. Throughout the quarter we will examine the language and histories of moving images and how
                        artists have contributed to and utilized them in their work. We will explore, compare, and
                        contrast industry-standard/normative approaches with radical/experimental takes of these various
                        media. Our aim is to establish a rich understanding of the complex and evolving environment in
                        which artists and designers have been creating moving image art. Students will explore
                        technical, critical, and creative tools to realize moving-image projects and to gain a deeper
                        understanding of moving images as a medium of expression and communication. In a series of
                        mini-assignments and group projects students will explore and study the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Principles of moving images: timing, perspective, change, and aesthetics.</li>
                        <li>Fundamentals of motion and animation: attributes, keyframes, interpolation, and blending.
                        </li>
                        <li>The basics of digital moving images: codecs, resolution, raster/vector, and conversion.</li>
                        <li>Means of exhibition and presentation: screening, immersive environment, web-based, and
                            projection mapping</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We will explore the field through lectures, readings, screenings, discussions and student
                        presentations. By the end of the quarter, students should have gained basic production and
                        postproduction skills as well as a good understanding of the key concepts relevant to
                        contemporary film, video, new media, installation and animation.<br><br></p>
                    <h4>Submission Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>Students submit their minitasks and projects to the <a href="https://cloud.dma.ucla.edu/">DMA
                            Cloud</a> server. This is how we will access, review, and grade your assignments. <a
                            href="https://cloud.dma.ucla.edu/">DMA Cloud</a> is accessible remotely through a web
                        interface, as well as locally in the studios during class.</p>
                    <p>You can access the submission directory using the following breadcrumbs:<br><code> file.dma Home
                            > myClasses > 120-24 > drop </code> </p>
                    <h3>Expectations</h3>
                    <h4>Tools/Software/Accounts</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A stable internet connection and a focused working environment</li>
                        <li>a personal computer (with a webcam and ideally headphones)</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> for 3D computer graphics</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h4>Grading</h4>
                    Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attendance & Participation 20%</li>
                        <li>Discord Interaction 10%</li>
                        <li>Minitasks 20%</li>
                        <li><a onclick="openSection('#projects', 'p1')">Midterm project</a> 25%</li>
                        <li><a onclick="openSection('#projects', 'p2')">Final project</a> 25%</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Project grades take into account conceptual, technical, and visual development as well as rigor
                        and creativity. Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs,
                        sufficient work that does nothing more than meeting the requirements will receive Cs.</p>
                    <h4>Attendance</h4>
                    <p>You get one unexcused absence, no questions asked. Each unexcused absence after that will result
                        in one full letter grade deduction. Three unexcused absences will result in a failed grade in
                        the class. If there is an emergency and you must miss class, email us before class. Absences
                        will not be excused after the fact except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctor’s
                        note. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you will be marked tardy. Three tardies result in
                        one unexcused absence. Any disputes should be discussed with the us within two weeks.</p>
                    <h4>Participation</h4>
                    <p>Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share your thoughts,
                        ask questions, prepare for class meetings & discussions, offer feedback during critiques. This
                        class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and
                        taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of different backgrounds,
                        perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we are building together. Don’t
                        assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility, apologize, and learn. Help each
                        other in this. If you have concerns, please let us know.</p>
                    <h4> <a href="https://discord.com/new" target="_blank">Discord</a> Server Interaction</h4>
                    <p>Ongoing weekly discussions and participation in the Discord server is required. We will use
                        Discord to gather & share resources, respond to readings and peers' works, and to share your
                        work in progress.</p>
                    Each week should feature at least:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reflections on, and responses to the readings.</li>
                        <li>Link to your minitask/project with a short description of your learning process, concept,
                            challenges, and triumphs. This way your work is contextualized for your peers in relation to
                            your creative inputs and the readings.</li>
                        <li>Respond to at least two of your peers' minitasks and project submissions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Readings & Discussions</h4>
                    During the quarter, we will have five discussions on a variety of topics. Each week you are required
                    to read one short text.
                    The readings are intended to familiarize you with some of the relevant discussions that
                    relate to moving images. You are required to submit a response for each week's reading on the
                    Discord server. Each week we will discuss our findings and thoughts with our peers. Your
                    participation in these discussions matter. The discussions serve as a dialectical engagement to
                    learn from one another and explore the
                    readings in conversation. Moreover, the readings serve as a foundation for discussing the
                    screenings, which are purposefully picked to convey some of the ideas from the readings in practice.
                    </p>
                    <h4><a onclick='openSection("#projects")'>Projects</a></h4>
                    Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned. Projects may be turned in up to one
                    week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one week
                    late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in projects online by
                    the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save issues, software errors,
                    computer crash, etc. You should regularly backup your files on your desktop, online, and/or on an
                    external harddrive or USB stick in case your computer is lost.</p>

                    <h3>Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces</h3>
                    <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic,
                        social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must
                        acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we
                        will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs.
                        Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization
                        and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race,
                        sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized.
                        Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and
                        discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and instructors is needed to create a
                        supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and
                        conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group
                        is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity
                        for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in
                        discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the
                        instructors. (<a href='https://github.com/voidlab/diversity-statement'>tx voidLab!</a>)</p>
                    <h3>Disability Services</h3>
                    <p>UCLA strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or
                        experience academic barriers based on a disability, please let me know as soon as possible. It
                        is necessary for you to register with the <a href='http://www.cae.ucla.edu/'>UCLA Center for
                            Accessible Education</a> so that we can establish reasonable accommodations. After
                        registration, make arrangements with me to discuss how to implement these accommodations.</p>
                    <h3>Land Acknowledgement</h3>
                    <p>The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary
                        Lands of the Tongva and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of
                        coercion, dispossession, and colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people
                        that have stewarded it through generations. While a land acknowledgement is not enough, it is
                        the first step in the work toward supporting decolonial and indigenous movements for sovereignty
                        and self-determination. <a href='https://native-land.ca/' target='_blank'>Read more about what

                        <p> On Monday we will explore options for rendering and video encoding. We will have a look at
                            specialized software for encoding and decoding videos, namely FFmpeg, Handbrake, Adobe Media
                            Encoder, and Davinci Resolve’ Render panel. We will explore where different codecs are
                            useful and how some of the prominent ones came to be. We will also explore the composting
                            options in Blender and Davinci Resolve and touch on some of the basic techniques used in
                            compositing. On Wednesday, we are going to have a look at the basics of motion tracking.

                        <p> Much like the previous week, this week is dedicated to compositing and post processing. We
                            will explore these ideas in much more depth. We will have our first look at Davinci
                            Resolve’s Fusion panel and learn about advanced file formats like OpenEXR. </p>

                        <p> This week’s workshops are aimed at executing a project from start to finish. We will begin
                            by collecting content, and creating our assets. Then we will construct a scene in Blender
                            using the animation technique that we’ve learned so far. We will also use some of our skills
                            in motion tracking. The final scene will be rendered and converted. </p>

                        week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one
                        week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in projects
                        online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save issues, software
                        errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly backup your files on your desktop, online,
                        and/or on an external harddrive or USB stick in case your computer is lost.</p>

                            throughout the course. As usual, it must be paired with audio and sound, which can be
                            musical, ambient, environmental, or experimental. The required length of the project is 3 to
                            5 minutes. You are free to explore any topic that interests you. These can range from
                            exploration of advanced and experimental techniques, software and frameworks that were not
                            touched on in the class, social and political issues, personal and interpersonal
                            investigations, investigations of aesthetics, etc. Collaboration, invention, and exploration
                            are highly encouraged, as such you are free to join groups of 2-3 people for your final
                            project. However, if you wish, you can work on the final project individually. </p>
