          <h3>Description</h3>

          <p>This course is an introduction and integration of traditional design tools, camera, and digital
            technologies for application to multidisciplinary visual thinking, design, communication, and art.
            Throughout the quarter we will examine the language and histories of moving images and how artists have
            contributed to and utilized them in their work. We will explore, compare, and contrast
            industry-standard/normative approaches with radical/experimental takes of these various media. Our aim is to
            establish a rich understanding of the complex and evolving environment in which artists and designers have
            been creating moving image art. Students will explore technical, critical, and creative tools to realize
            moving-image projects and to gain a deeper understanding of moving images as a medium of expression and
            communication. In a series of mini-assignments and group projects students will explore and study the
            following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Principles of moving images: timing, perspective, change, and aesthetics.</li>
            <li>Fundamentals of motion and animation: attributes, keyframes, interpolation, and blending.</li>
            <li>The basics of digital moving images: codecs, resolution, raster/vector, and conversion.</li>
            <li>Means of exhibition and presentation: screening, immersive environment, web-based, and projection
              mapping</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We will explore the field through lectures, readings, screenings, discussions and student presentations. By
            the end of the quarter, students should have gained basic production and postproduction skills as well as a
            good understanding of the key concepts relevant to contemporary film, video, new media, installation and
            animation.<br><br>
            <i>
              Note: This syllabus was designed for in-person and on-campus teaching. As COVID-19 has changed the
              dynamics of our learning experience, this syllabus will be modified and adjusted to conform and address
              the needs of the class as we progress throughout the quarter.
            </i></p>

          <h3>Supplementary Material</h3>
          <p>All supplementary materials will be provided through a dedicated Google Drive folder. This will be shared
            with everyone and includes our readings, video tutorials, guides, software, cheatsheets, and most
            importantly
            the required assets needed for class projects.</p>

          <h3>Expectations</h3>
          <h4>Grading</h4>
          Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
          <ul>
            <li>Midterm project 25%</li>
            <li>Final project 25%</li>
            <li>Final project documentation 10%</li>
            <li>Participation 20%</li>
            <li>Minitasks 20%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Project grades take into account conceptual, technical, and visual development as well as rigor and
            creativity. Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs, sufficient work that
            does nothing more than meeting the requirements will receive Cs.</p>

          <h4><a onclick='openSection("#projects")'>Projects</a></h4>
          Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned. Projects may be turned in up to one week late for
          a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one week late will not be accepted.
          If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be
          given for work lost due to save issues, software errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly backup your
          files on your desktop, online, and/or on an external harddrive or USB stick in case your computer is lost.</p>

          <h4><a onclick='openSection("#readings")'>Readings & Discussions</a></h4>
          During the quarter, we will have five discussions on a variety of topics. With the exception of the first
          week, the readings for every week are divided into two topics (signified below with A and B). Each week you
          are required to read at least one article from each topic. The readings are intended to familiarize you with
          some of the relevant discussions that relate to moving images. You are not required to write a written
          response. However every week we will discuss the readings with your peers. Your participation in these
          discussions will count towards your grade. It is highly recommended to take notes from the readings so that
          you can easily engage with the topic and the discussion. Since every student is only required to read one
          article (per topic), the discussions serve as a dialectical engagement to learn from one another and explore
          the readings in conversation. Moreover, the readings serve as a foundation for discussing the screenings,
          which are purposefully picked to convey some of the ideas from the readings in practice.</p>

          <h4>Participation</h4>
          <p>Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share your thoughts, ask
            questions, prepare for meetings, offer feedback during critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in
            which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being aware and
            considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we are
            building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility, apologize, and learn.
            Help each other in this. If you have concerns, please let us know.</p>

          <h4>Attendance</h4>
          <p>You get one unexcused absence, no questions asked. Each unexcused absence after that will result in one
            full letter grade deduction. Three unexcused absences will result in a failed grade in the class. If there
            is an emergency and you must miss class, email us before class. Absences will not be excused after the fact
            except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctor’s note. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you
            will be marked tardy. Three tardies result in one unexcused absence. Any disputes should be discussed with
            the us
            within two weeks.</p>

          <h3>Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces</h3>
          <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and
            cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the
            different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect
            self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our
            differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to
            remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are
            undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during
            debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and instructors is needed to create a
            supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually,
            if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being
            defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one
            another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is
            harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructors. (<a

          <h3>Disability Services</h3>
          <p>UCLA strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience
            academic barriers based on a disability, please let me know as soon as possible. It is necessary for you to
            register with the <a href='http://www.cae.ucla.edu/'>UCLA Center for Accessible Education</a> so that we can
            establish reasonable accommodations. After registration, make arrangements with me to discuss how to
            implement these accommodations.</p>

          <h3>Land Acknowledgement</h3>
          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of
            the Tongva and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of coercion,
            dispossession, and colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people that have stewarded it
            through generations. While a land acknowledgement is not enough, it is the first step in the work toward
            supporting decolonial and indigenous movements for sovereignty and self-determination. <a

              <p>
                Create a 20 seconds video using Blender and found content. For this minitask you must combine
                both
                2D and
                3D elements and synchronize the animation with sound. 2D elements must have animated shapes,
                while
                3D
                elements can be animated as you wish (geometry, material, etc.). Using Davinci Resolve you
                must
                composite
                the video. Take the time to explore the nodes in the Color panel of the software.

                seconds looping video from your Midterm Project submission. We will convert this video using
                four
                different encoding settings:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>WebM VP9 with 2 MBit/s bit rate and transparency</li>
                <li>Two-pass H.264 with a restricted file size of 200 megabytes and 128k audio</li>
                <li>Gif with custom color palette, resized to half the size of original footage, and with 15
                  fps</li>
                <li>ProRes 444 lossless</li>
              </ul>

                On Monday we will explore options for rendering and video encoding. We will have a look at
                specialized
                software for encoding and decoding videos, namely FFmpeg, Handbrake, Adobe Media Encoder, and
                Davinci
                Resolve’ Render panel. We will explore where different codecs are useful and how some of the
                prominent
                ones came to be. We will also explore the composting options in Blender and Davinci Resolve
                and touch on
                some of the basic techniques used in compositing. On Wednesday, we are going to have a look at
                the
                basics of motion tracking, projection mapping, and immersive video installation. <b>Wednesday

                Choose a short footage of your own or a readily available one. We will be using this for a
                quick motion
                tracking experiment. The length of the footage should not exceed 30 seconds. Augment this
                footage using
                the motion tracking techniques that we’ve learned in Blender. Apply post processing and
                composite in
                Davinci Resolve to seamlessly blend the added elements and the original footage.</p>

                Much like the previous week, this week is dedicated to compositing and post processing. We
                will explore
                these ideas in much more depth. We will have our first look at Davinci Resolve’s Fusion panel
                and learn
                about advanced file formats like OpenEXR.

              <p>
                This week’s workshops are aimed at executing a project from start to finish. We will begin by
                collecting
                content, and creating our assets. Then we will construct a scene in Blender using the
                animation
                technique that we’ve learned so far. We will also use some of our skills in motion tracking.
                The final
                scene will be rendered, converted, and projection mapped in class. <b>Subject to change due to
                  online
                  teaching.</b>
